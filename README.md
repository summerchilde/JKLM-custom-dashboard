JKLM-custom-dashboard
=====================

Simple plugin to customize the WordPress dashboard. 

By editing the jklm_custom_dash.php file you can change the following parts of the WordPress dashboard:

1. Can remove default widgets from Appearance.
2. Reorder Dashboard menu items.
3. Rename Dashboard menu items.
4. Change the Howdy.
5. Hide Dashboard Menu items
6. Remove the Welcome panel.
7. Change the footer credit.

Additionally, this plugin adds a custom dashboard widget that introduces Dashboard menu to new users. I originally made
this plugin for my less internet savvy clients.
